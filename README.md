# NOTE
All the files present in this github repository(other than the "Builds" folder) are sufficient to clone the project in your target machine, with all the settings matching the parent machine. 
The only folder missing here in this repository is the "library" folder which contains the pre built packages and settings by Unity. 
When you load the folder with all contents of this repository("Builds" folder not necessary) as a project in Unity, Unity will generate the "library" folder itself to clone the project with parent machine's settings.
